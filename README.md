# 5001
5001 Individual Project
Run the program will got test.csv

Programming languages:
- Python is used for the individual project.
- Coding is done in google colaboratory.
- The program sources are saved as 5001_Ind.ipynb

The following packages and libraries are required:
- from datetime import datetime, timedelta, date
- from IPython.display import display
- from keras.backend import clear_session
- from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
- from keras.layers import Dense
- from keras.models import load_model, Sequential
- from keras.optimizers import Adam, RMSprop, SGD
- from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix
- from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
- from sys import exit
- from tensorflow.keras import activations
- import math
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import numpy as np
- import pandas as pd
- import pickle as pkl
- import seaborn as sns
- import statsmodels.api as sm
- import sys
- import tensorflow as tf
- import time

Reproduce the result by the following steps:
Import all the libraries
Upload test.csv, train.csv, best_model_file.h5
My result test_20660026.csv
